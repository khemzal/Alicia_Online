### Github 
Most users do have Github installed and are logged in. However, if not, create an account on github.com and run the downloader installer from https://desktop.github.com/download/. Make sure add GIT to Path is enabled. You can check by running Powershell and typing ```git --version``` <br> <img width="218" height="63" alt="obrazek" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/beeedc76-5c4d-4ab4-867a-d3f06214bbea" />
